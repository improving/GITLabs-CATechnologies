# Git Notes
This is the Git notes from the 2-day training session at ImprovingEnterprises on Jan 21-22, 2015.
## Git Overview

## Command Line Cheat Sheet
Verify Git installation
```
git --version
```
Get help with Git
```
git help
```
### Working Locally
Start git at a folder
```
git init
```
#My Notes Here:
1. Basic flow to be followed always is Code - Add - Commit.
2. A single command to add and commit if the add is successful:
    git add -A . && git commit -m "commit message"
